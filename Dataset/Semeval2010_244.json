The standardization of grids based on web services has resulted in the need for scalable web service discovery mechanisms to be deployed in grids Even though UDDI has been the de facto industry standard for web-services discovery, imposed requirements of tight-replication among registries and lack of autonomous control has severely hindered its widespread deployment and usage. With the advent of grid computing the scalability issue of UDDI will become a roadblock that will prevent its deployment in grids. In this paper we present our distributed web-service discovery architecture, called DUDE (Distributed UDDI Deployment Engine). DUDE leverages DHT (Distributed Hash Tables) as a rendezvous mechanism between multiple UDDI registries. DUDE enables consumers to query multiple registries, still at the same time allowing organizations to have autonomous control over their registries.. Based on preliminary prototype on PlanetLab, we believe that DUDE architecture can support effective distribution of UDDI registries thereby making UDDI more robust and also addressing its scaling issues. Furthermore, The DUDE architecture for scalable distribution can be applied beyond UDDI to any Grid Service Discovery mechanism.", "references": ["P-grid: A self-organizing structured p2p system", "GridVine: Building Internet-Scale Semantic Overlay Networks", "PlanetP: Using Gossiping to Build Content Addressable Peer-to-Peer Information Sharing Communities", "Self-Managing Federated Services", "On Death, Taxes, and the Convergence of P2P and Grid Computing", "The Physiology of the Grid: An Open Grid Services Architecture for Distributed Systems Integration", "Was the Universal Service Registry a Dream?", "Pastry: Scalable, distributed object location and routing for large scale peer-to-peer systems", "Grid information services for distributed resource sharing", "Handling churn in a DHT", "Ontology-based Resource Matching in the Grid - The Grid Meets the Semantic Web", "Web Services Dynamic Discovery (WS-Discovery) Specification", "Information Services (MDS): Key Concepts", "G- QoSM: Grid Service Discovery using QoS Properties", "UDDIe: An Extended Registry for Web Services", "A Market-Oriented Grid Directory Service for Publication and Discovery of Grid Service Providers and their Services", "An Architecture Providing QoS-Aware and Federated Support for UDDI", "Service Discovery Supporting Open Scalability Using FIPA Compliant Agent Platform for Ubiquitous Networks"], "title": "Scalable Grid Service Discovery Based on UDDI"}

Thus, the loss of packets impairs the application-level utility. For voice this utility impairment is twofold: on one hand, even short bursts of lost packets may decrease significantly the ability of the receiver to conceal the packet loss and the speech signal playout is interrupted. On the other hand, some packets may be particular sensitive to loss as they carry more important information in terms of user perception than other packets. We first develop an end-to-end model based on loss runlengths with which we can describe the loss distribution within a flow. These packet-level metrics are then linked to user-level objective speech quality metrics. Using this framework, we find that for low-compressing sample-based codecs (PCM) with loss concealment isolated packet losses can be concealed well, whereas burst losses have a higher perceptual impact. For high-compressing frame-based codecs (G.729) on one hand the impact of loss is amplified through error propagation caused by the decoder filter memories, though on the other hand such coding schemes help to perform loss concealment by extrapolation of decoder state. Contrary to sample-based codecs we show that the concealment performance may "break" at transitions within the speech signal however. We then propose mechanisms which differentiate between packets within a voice data ow to minimize the impact of packet loss. We designate these methods as "intra-flow" loss recovery and control. At the end-to-end level, identification of packets sensitive to loss (sender) as well as loss concealment (receiver) takes place. Hop-by-hop support schemes then allow to (statistically) trade the loss of one packet, which is considered more important, against another one of the same flow which is of lower importance. As both packets require the same cost in terms of network transmission, a gain in user perception is obtainable. We show that significant speech quality improvements can be achieved and additional data and delay overhead can be avoided while still maintaining a network service which is virtually identical to best effort in the long term.", "references": ["Understanding end-to-end internet traffic dynamics", "Adaptive FEC-based error control for interactive audio in the Internet", "Explicit allocation of best effort packet delivery service", "Low bit-rate speech coders for multimedia communication", "Low bit-rate speech coders for multimedia communication", "QoS measurement of Internet real-time multimedia services", "RTP payload for redundant audio data", "Simulation of FEC-based error control for packet audio on the nternet", "729 error recovery for Internet Telephony", "Integrating packet FEC into adaptive voice playout buffer algorithms on the Internet", "Integrating packet FEC into adaptive voice playout buffer algorithms on the Internet", "Packet Loss Recovery and Control for Voice tinsmission over the Internet", "Packet Loss Recovery and Control for Voice tinsmission over the Internet", "Efficient QoS support for Voice-over-IP applications using selective packet marking", "Loss correlation for queues with bursty input streams", "LDAf TCP-friendly adaptation: A measurement and comparison study", "Coding of speech at 8 kbit/s using conjugate-structure algebraic-code-excited linear-prediction (CS-ACELP)", "Objective oualitv measurement of telephone-band (300-3400 Hz) speech codecs", "Towsley.

Keeping track of (or managing) such content remains challenging due to the sheer volume of data. Storing "live" continuous media (such as TV or radio content) adds to the complexity in that this content has no well defined start or end and is therefore cumbersome to deal with. Networked storage allows content that is logically viewed as part of the same collection to in fact be distributed across a network, making the task of content management all but impossible to deal with without a content management system. In this paper we present the design and implementation of the Spectrum content management system, which deals with rich media content effectively in this environment.Spectrum has a modular architecture that allows its application to both stand- alone and various networked scenarios. A unique aspect of Spectrum is that it requires one (or more) retention policies to apply to every piece of content that is stored in the system. This means that there are no eviction policies. Content that no longer has a retention policy applied to it is simply removed from the system. Different retention policies can easily be applied to the same content thus naturally facilitating sharing without duplication. This approach also allows Spectrum to easily apply time based policies which are basic building blocks required to deal with the storage of live continuous media, to content.

The theory of causality has been the foundation of all prior OT systems, but it is inadequate to capture essential correctness requirements. Past research had invented various patches to work around this problem, resulting in increasingly intricate and complicated OT algorithms.

In this paper, we report the main results of this effort: the theory of operation context and the COT (Context-based OT) algorithm. The COT algorithm is capable of supporting both do and undo of any operations at anytime, without requiring transformation functions to preserve Reversibility Property, Convergence Property 2, Inverse Properties 2 and 3.

Although the main action that the Slammer worm takes is a relatively unsophisticated replication of itself, it still spreads so quickly that human response was ineffective. Most proposed countermeasures strategies are based primarily on rate detection and limiting algorithms. However, such strategies are being designed and developed to effectively contain worms whose behaviors are similar to that of Slammer.In our work, we put forth the hypothesis that next generation worms will be radically different, and potentially such techniques will prove ineffective. Specifically, we propose to study a new generation of worms called "Swarm Worms", whose behavior is predicated on the concept of "emergent intelligence". Emergent Intelligence is the behavior of systems, very much like biological systems such as ants or bees, where simple local interactions of autonomous members, with simple primitive actions, gives rise to complex and intelligent global behavior. In this manuscript we will introduce the basic principles behind the idea of "Swarm Worms", as well as the basic structure required in order to be considered a "swarm worm". In addition, we will present preliminary results on the propagation speeds of one such swarm worm, called the ZachiK worm.

This paper presents Bullet, a scalable and distributed algorithm that enables nodes spread across the Internet to self-organize into a high bandwidth overlay mesh. We construct Bullet around the insight that data should be distributed in a disjoint manner to strategic points in the network. Individual Bullet receivers are then responsible for locating and retrieving the data from multiple points in parallel.Key contributions of this work include: i) an algorithm that sends data to different points in the overlay such that any data object is equally likely to appear at any node, ii) a scalable and decentralized algorithm that allows nodes to locate and recover missing data items, and iii) a complete implementation and evaluation of Bullet running across the Internet and in a large-scale emulation environment reveals up to a factor two bandwidth improvements under a variety of circumstances. In addition, we find that, relative to tree-based solutions, Bullet reduces the need to perform expensive bandwidth probing. In a tree, it is critical that a node's parent delivers a high rate of application data to each child. In Bullet however, nodes simultaneously receive data from multiple sources in parallel, making it less important to locate any single source capable of sustaining a high transmission rate.", "references": ["Scalable Application Layer Multicast", "Bimodal Multicast", "Bittorrent", "Space/Time Trade-offs in Hash Coding with Allowable Errors", "On the Resemblance and Containment of Documents", "Informed Content Delivery Across Adaptive Overlay Networks", "A Digital Fountain Approach to Reliable Distribution of Bulk Data", "Modeling Internet Topology", "Splitstream: High-bandwidth Content Distribution in Cooperative Environments", "Towards Capturing Representative AS-Level Internet Topologies", "FastReplica: Efficient Large File Distribution within Content Delivery Networks", "A Unicast-based Approach for Streaming Multicast", "Lightweight Probabilistic Broadcast", "Lightweight Probabilistic Broadcast", "Equation-based congestion control for unicast applications", "A Reliable Multicast Framework for Light-weight Sessions and Application Level Framing", "Multiple Description Coding: Compression Meets the Network", "A Case For End System Multicast", "Enabling Conferencing Applications on the Internet using an Overlay Multicast Architecture", "End-to-end Available Bandwidth: Measurement Methodology, Dynamics, and Relation with TCP Throughput", "Overcast: Reliable Multicasting with an Overlay Network", " Kazaa media desktop", "Optimal Distribution Tree for Internet Streaming Media", "Using Random Subsets to Build Scalable Network Services", "LT Codes", "Practical Loss-Resilient Codes", "Modeling TCP Throughput: A Simple Model and its Empirical Validation", "Server-based Inference of Internet Link Lossiness", "Resilient Peer-to-Peer Streaming", "Distributing Streaming Media Content Using Cooperative Networking", "A Blueprint for Introducing Disruptive Technology into the Internet", "Shortest Connection Networks and Some Generalizations", "MACEDON: Methodology for Automatically Creating, Evaluating, and Designing Overlay Networks", "SCRIBE: The Design of a Large-scale Event Notification Infrastructure", "Sting: A TCP-based Network Measurement Tool", "Mesh-Based Content Routing Using XML", "Scalability and Accuracy in a Large-Scale Network Emulator"], "title": "Bullet: High Bandwidth Data Dissemination Using an Overlay Mesh"}

To achieve this goal, PRO adopts a receiver-driven approach where each receiver (or participating peer) (i) independently discovers other peers in the overlay through gossiping, and (ii) selfishly determines the best subset of parent peers through which to connect to the overlay to maximize its own delivered bandwidth. Participating peers form an unstructured overlay which is inherently robust to high churn rate. than structured overlay networks. Furthermore, each receiver leverages congestion controlled bandwidth from its parents as implicit signal to detect and react to long-term changes in network or overlay condition without any explicit coordination with other participating peers.

They are filled with autonomous, mutable virtual content which is continuously augmented by the users. To make the systems highly scalable and dynamically extensible, they are usually built on a client--server based grid subspace division where the virtual worlds are partitioned into manageable sub--worlds. In each sub--world, the user continuously receives relevant geometry updates of moving objects from remotely connected servers and renders them according to her viewpoint, rather than retrieving them from a local storage medium. In such systems, the determination of the set of objects that are visible from a user's viewpoint is one of the primary factors that affect server throughput and scalability. Specifically, performing real--time visibility tests in extremely dynamic virtual environments is a very challenging task as millions of objects and sub-millions of active users are moving and interacting. We recognize that the described challenges are closely related to a spatial database problem, and hence we map the moving geometry objects in the virtual space to a set of multi-dimensional objects in a spatial database while modeling each avatar both as a spatial object and a moving query. Unfortunately, existing spatial indexing methods are unsuitable for this kind of new environments.The main goal of this paper is to present an efficient spatial index structure that minimizes unexpected object popping and supports highly scalable real--time visibility determination. We then uncover many useful properties of this structure and compare the index structure with various spatial indexing methods in terms of query quality, system throughput, and resource utilization.

{"id": "H-11", "keywords": "imag retriev;activ learn;relev feedback", "abstract": "Relevance feedback is a powerful technique to enhance ContentBased Image Retrieval (CBIR) performance. It solicits the user's relevance judgments on the retrieved images returned by the CBIR systems. The user's labeling is then used to learn a classifier to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant images. However, the top returned images may not be the most informative ones. The challenge is thus to determine which unlabeled images would be the most informative (i.e., improve the classifier the most) if they were labeled and used as training samples. In this paper, we propose a novel active learning algorithm, called Laplacian Optimal Design (LOD), for relevance feedback image retrieval. Our algorithm is based on a regression model which minimizes the least square error on the measured (or, labeled) images and simultaneously preserves the local geometrical structure of the image space. Specifically, we assume that if two images are sufficiently close to each other, then their measurements (or, labels) are close as well. By constructing a nearest neighbor graph, the geometrical structure of the image space can be described by the graph Laplacian. We discuss how results from the field of optimal experimental design may be used to guide our selection of a subset of images, which gives us the most amount of information.

These experiments reveal that finding documents on secondary storage dominates the total cost of generating snippets, and so caching documents in RAM is essential for a fast snippet generation process. Using simulation, we examine snippet generation performance for different size RAM caches.

In order to cope with the vast amounts of query loads, search engines prune their index to keep documents that are likely to be returned as top results, and use this pruned index to compute the first batches of results. While this approach can im- prove performance by reducing the size of the index, if we compute the top results only from the pruned index we may notice a signif- icant degradation in the result quality: if a document should be in the top results but was not included in the pruned index, it will be placed behind the results computed from the pruned index. Given the fierce competition in the online search market, this phenomenon is clearly undesirable. In this paper, we study how we can avoid any degradation of result quality due to the pruning-based performance optimization, while still realizing most of its benefit. Our contribution is a num- ber of modifications in the pruning techniques for creating the pruned index and a new result computation algorithm that guar- antees that the top-matching pages are always placed at the top search results, even though we are computing the first batch from the pruned index most of the time.

In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised method for shared topic detection and topic segmentation of multiple similar documents based on mutual information (MI) and weighted mutual information (WMI) that is a combination of MI and term weights. The basic idea is that the optimal segmen- tation maximizes MI(or WMI). Our approach can detect shared topics among documents. It can flnd the optimal boundaries in a document, and align segments among docu- ments at the same time. It also can handle single-document segmentation as a special case of the multi-document seg- mentation and alignment. Our methods can identify and strengthen cue terms that can be used for segmentation and partially remove stop words by using term weights based on entropy learned from multiple documents. Our experimental results show that our algorithm works well for the tasks of single-document segmentation, shared topic detection, and multi-document segmentation.

The technique, called latent concept expansion, provides a mechanism for modeling term dependencies during expan- sion. Furthermore, the use of arbitrary features within the model provides a powerful framework for going beyond sim- ple term occurrence features that are implicitly used by most other expansion techniques. We evaluate our tech- nique against relevance models, a state-of-the-art language modeling query expansion technique. Our model demon- strates consistent and significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness across several TREC data sets. We also de- scribe how our technique can be used to generate mean- ingful multi-term concepts for tasks such as query sugges- tion/reformulation.", "references": ["UMass at TREC 2004: Novelty and HARD", "Shortest-substring retrieval and ranking", "Query expansion using random walk models", "Boolean queries and term dependencies in probabilistic retrieval models", "The use of phrases and structured queries in information retrieval", "NTCIR-5 query expansion experiments using term dependence models", "Automatic phrase indexing for document retrieval: An examination of syntactic and non-syntactic methods", "Dependence language model for information retrieval", "An evaluation of feedback in document retrieval using co-occurrence data", "A support vector method for multivariate performance measures", "Corpus structure, language models, and ad-hoc information retrieval", "Relevance-based language models", "Cluster-based retrieval using language models", "A Markov random field model for term dependencies", "Linear feature based models for information retrieval", "Indri at terabyte track 2005", "Direct maximization of average precision by hill-climbing with a comparison to a maximum entropy approach", "Experiments using the lemur toolkit", "Why bigger windows are better than smaller ones", "Okapi at trec-3", "Relevance Feedback in Information Retrieval", "A general language model for information retrieval", "Indri: A language model-based serach engine for complex queries", "Language model information retrieval with document expansion", "Max-margin markov networks", "A theoretical basis for the use of cooccurrence data in information retrieval", "LDA-based document models for ad-hoc retrieval", "Improving the effectiveness of information retrieval with local context analysis", "Model-based feedback in the language modeling approach to information retrieval"], "title": "Latent Concept Expansion Using Markov Random Fields"}

Most existing models are based on multinomial distribution and would score documents based on query likelihood computed based on a query generation probabilistic model.

We show that while in their simplest forms, the new family of models and the existing multinomial models are equivalent, they behave difierently for many smoothing methods.

To avoid undesirable bias in relatively heterogeneous environments while effectively using relevant data to improve its estimations, the mechanism weighs the contributions of other agents' observations based on a real-time estimation of the level of similarity between each of these agents and itself. The "coordination autonomy" module of a coordination-manager system provided an empirical setting for evaluation.

However, power indices (which reflect how much "real power" a voter has in a weighted voting system) have received relatively little attention, although they have long been studied in political science and economics. The Banzhaf power index is one of the most popular; it is also well-defined for any simple coalitional game. In this paper, we examine the computational complexity of cal- culating the Banzhaf power index within a particular multiagent do- main, a network flow game. Agents control the edges of a graph; a coalition wins if it can send a flow of a given size from a source ver- tex to a target vertex.

The goal is to maximize the joint quality obtained from the activities executed by all agents, given that, during execution, unex- pected events will force changes to some prescribed activi- ties and reduce the utility of executing others. We describe an agent architecture for solving this problem that couples two basic mechanisms: (1) a "flexible times" representation of the agent's schedule (using a Simple Temporal Network) and (2) an incremental rescheduling procedure. The former hedges against temporal uncertainty by allowing execution to proceed from a set of feasible solutions, and the latter acts to revise the agent's schedule when execution is forced out- side of this set of solutions or when execution events reduce the expected value of this feasible solution set. Basic coordi- nation with other agents is achieved simply by communicat- ing schedule changes to those agents with inter-dependent activities. Then, as time permits, the core local problem solving infra-structure is used to drive an inter-agent option generation and query process, aimed at identifying opportu- nities for solution improvement through joint change.

Likewise, there will be situations when an action is both obliged and prohibited, that is, an inconsis- tency arises.

More gener- ally, we can capture a useful notion of inter-agent (and inter-role) delegation of actions and norms associated to them, and use it to address conicts/inconsistencies caused by action delegation.

Within a NS, conflicts may arise due to the dynamic nature of the MAS and the concurrency of agents' actions. However, ensuring conflict-freedom of a NS at design time is computationally intractable. We show this by formalising the notion of conflict, providing a mapping of NSs into Coloured Petri Nets and borrowing well-known theoretical results from that field.

However, the VCG mechanism is not (strongly) budget balanced: generally, the agents' payments will sum to more than 0. If there is an auctioneer who is selling the items, this may be desirable, because the surplus payment corresponds to revenue for the auctioneer. However, if the items do not have an owner and the agents are merely interested in allocating the items efficiently among themselves, any surplus payment is undesirable, because it will have to flow out of the system of agents. In 2006, Cavallo [3] proposed a mechanism that redistributes some of the VCG payment back to the agents, while maintaining efficiency, strategy-proofness, individual rationality, and the non-deficit property. In this paper, we extend this result in a restricted setting. We study allocation settings where there are multiple indistinguishable units of a single good, and agents have unit demand. (For this specific setting, Cavallo's mechanism coincides with a mechanism proposed by Bailey in 1997 [2].) Here we propose a family of mechanisms that redistribute some of the VCG payment back to the agents. All mechanisms in the family are efficient, strategy-proof, individually rational, and never incur a deficit. The family includes the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism as a special case. We then provide an optimization model for finding the optimal mechanism--that is, the mechanism that maximizes redistribution in the worst case--inside the family, and show how to cast this model as a linear program. We give both numerical and analytical solutions of this linear program, and the (unique) resulting mechanism shows significant improvement over the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism (in the worst case).

There are a range of reasons why this phenomenon occurs, many of which -- based on legal, social, or business considerations -- seem to defy concise mathematical models. Despite this, we show that the advantages of limited compatibility can arise in a very simple model of diffusion in social networks, thus offering a basic explanation for this phenomenon in purely strategic terms. Our approach builds on work on the diffusion of innovations in the economics literature, which seeks to model how a new technology A might spread through a social network of individuals who are currently users of technology B. We consider several ways of capturing the compatibility of A and B, focusing primarily on a model in which users can choose to adopt A, adopt B, or -- at an extra cost -- adopt both A and B. We characterize how the ability of A to spread depends on both its quality relative to B, and also this additional cost of adopting both, and find some surprising non-monotonicity properties in the dependence on these parameters: in some cases, for one technology to survive the introduction of another, the cost of adopting both technologies must be balanced within a narrow, intermediate range.

Formally, an item graph is a graph whose nodes are in one-to-one correspondence with items, and edges are such that for any bid, the items occurring in it induce a connected subgraph. Note that many item graphs might be associated with a given combinatorial auction, depending on the edges selected for guaranteeing the connectedness.

Motivated by this bad news, we investigate different kinds of structural requirements that can be used to isolate tractable classes of combinatorial auctions. We show that the notion of hypertree decomposition, a recently introduced measure of hypergraph cyclicity, turns out to be most useful here. Indeed, we show that the winner determination problem is solvable in polynomial time on instances whose bidder interactions can be represented with (dual) hypergraphs having bounded hypertree width.

We study a well-motivated special case of this problem, where the processing time of a job on each machine may either be "low" or "high", and the low and high values are public and job-dependent. This preserves the multidimensional- ity of the domain, and generalizes the restricted-machines (i.e., {pj, ∞}) setting in scheduling.

This is one of the few known results that shows how to export ap- proximation algorithms for a multidimensional problem into truthful mechanisms in a black-box fashion. When the low and high values are the same for all jobs, we devise a de- terministic 2-approximation truthful mechanism. These are the first truthful mechanisms with non-trivial performance guarantees for a multidimensional scheduling domain. Our constructions are novel in two respects. First, we do not utilize or rely on explicit price definitions to prove truthfulness; instead we design algorithms that satisfy cy- cle monotonicity. Cycle monotonicity (23) is a necessary and sufficient condition for truthfulness, is a generalization of value monotonicity for multidimensional domains. How- ever, whereas value monotonicity has been used extensively and successfully to design truthful mechanisms in single- dimensional domains, ours is the first work that leverages cycle monotonicity in the multidimensional setting.

VCG position auctions, which are currently not used in practice, possess some nice theoretical properties, such as the optimization of social surplus and having dominant strategies. These properties may not be satisfied by current position auctions and their variants. We therefore concentrate on the search for mediators that will allow to transform current position auctions into VCG position auctions.

These swaps consist of cycles of agents, with each agent receiving the item of the next agent in the cycle. We focus mainly on the upcoming national kidney-exchange market, where patients with kidney disease can obtain compatible donors by swapping their own willing but incompatible donors. With over 70,000 patients already waiting for a cadaver kidney in the US, this market is seen as the only ethical way to significantly reduce the 4,000 deaths per year attributed to kidney diseas. The clearing problem involves finding a social welfare maximizing exchange when the maximum length of a cycle is fixed. Long cycles are forbidden, since, for incentive reasons, all transplants in a cycle must be performed simultaneously. Also, in barter-exchanges generally, more agents are affected if one drops out of a longer cycle. We prove that the clearing problem with this cycle-length constraint is NP-hard. Solving it exactly is one of the main challenges in establishing a national kidney exchange. We present the first algorithm capable of clearing these markets on a nationwide scale. The key is incremental problem formulation. We adapt two paradigms for the task: constraint generation and column generation. For each, we develop techniques that dramatically improve both runtime and memory usage. We conclude that column generation scales drastically better than constraint generation.

Informally, the "frugality ratio" is the ratio of the total payment of a mechanism to a desired payment bound. The ratio captures the extent to which the mechanism overpays, relative to perceived fair cost in a truthful auction. In this paper, we propose a new truthful polynomial-time auction for the vertex cover problem and bound its frugality ratio. We show that the solution quality is with a constant factor of optimal and the frugality ratio is within a constant factor of the best possible worst-case bound; this is the first auction for this problem to have these properties. Moreover, we show how to transform any truthful auction into a frugal one while preserving the approximation ratio. Also, we consider two natural modifications of the definition of Karlin et al., and we analyse the properties of the resulting payment bounds, such as monotonicity, computational hardness, and robustness with respect to the draw-resolution rule.

The present paper complements this line of research by introducing a statistical model and a measure of complexity through which we are able to study the learnability of classes of demand functions and derive a degree of confidence in the forecasts.Our results show that the class of all demand functions has unbounded complexity and therefore is not learnable, but that there exist interesting and potentially useful classes that are learnable from finite samples.

When the number of players is large, and the underlying graph has low degree, they provide a concise way to represent the players' payoffs. It has recently been shown that the problem of finding Nash equilibria in a general degree-3 graphical game with two actions per player is complete for the complexity class PPAD, indicating that it is unlikely that there is any polynomial-time algorithm for this problem. In this paper, we study the complexity of graphical games with two actions per player on bounded-degree trees. This setting was first considered by Kearns, Littman and Singh, who proposed a dynamic programming-based algorithm that computes all Nash equilibria of such games. The running time of their algorithm is exponential, though approximate equilibria can be computed efficiently. Later, Littman, Kearns and Singh proposed a modification to this algorithm that can find a single Nash equilibrium in polynomial time. We show that this modified algorithm is incorrect-the output is not always a Nash equilibrium. We then propose a new algorithm that is based on the ideas of Kearns et al. and computes all Nash equilibria in quadratic time if the input graph is a path, and in polynomial time if it is an arbitrary graph of maximum degree 2. Moreover, our algorithm can be used to compute Nash equilibria of graphical games on arbitrary trees, but the running time can be exponential, even when the tree has bounded degree. We show that this is inevitable -- any algorithm of this type will take exponential time, even on bounded-degree trees with pathwidth 2. It is an open question whether our algorithm runs in polynomial time on graphs with pathwidth 1, but we show that finding a Nash equilibrium for a 2-action graphical game in which the underlying graph has maximum degree 3 and constant pathwidth is PPAD-complete (so is unlikely to be tractable).", "references": ["Efficient and constructive algorithms for the pathwidth and treewidth of graphs", "3-NASH is PPAD-complete", "Settling the complexity of 2-player Nash equilibrium", "The complexity of computing a Nash equilibrium", "Three-player games are hard", "Nash equilibria in graphical games on trees revisited", "Reducibility among equilibrium problems", "Graphical models for game theory", "An efficient exact algorithm for singly connected graphical games", "Nash propagation for loopy graphical games", "On the complexity of the parity argument and other inefficient proofs of existence"], "title": "Nash Equilibria in Graphical Games on Trees Revisited"}

Most of these need to identify the locations of wireless sensor nodes, a challenging task because of the severe constraints on cost, energy and effective range of sensor devices. To overcome limitations in existing solutions, we present a Multi-Sequence Positioning (MSP) method for large-scale stationary sensor node localization in outdoor environments. The novel idea behind MSP is to reconstruct and estimate two-dimensional location information for each sensor node by processing multiple one-dimensional node sequences, easily obtained through loosely guided event distribution. Starting from a basic MSP design, we propose four optimizations, which work together to increase the localization accuracy. We address several interesting issues, such as incomplete (partial) node sequences and sequence flip, found in the Mirage test-bed we built. We have evaluated the MSP system through theoretical analysis, extensive simulation as well as two physical systems (an indoor version with 46 MICAz motes and an outdoor version with 20 MICAz motes). This evaluation demonstrates that MSP can achieve an accuracy within one foot, requiring neither additional costly hardware on sensor nodes nor precise event distribution.

The object is placed at the receiver at the position indicated by the dead-reckoning vector, but by that time, the real position could have changed considerably at the sender. This inaccuracy would be tolerable if it is consistent among all players; that is, at the same physical time, all players see inaccurate (with respect to the real position of the object) but the same position and trajectory for an object. But due to varying network delays between the sender and different receivers, the inaccuracy is different at different players as well. This leads to unfairness in game playing. In this paper, we first introduce an "error" measure for estimating this inaccuracy. Then we develop an algorithm for scheduling the sending of dead-reckoning vectors at a sender that strives to make this error equal at different receivers over time. This algorithm makes the game very fair at the expense of increasing the overall mean error of all players. To mitigate this effect, we propose a budget based algorithm that provides improved fairness without increasing the mean error thereby maintaining the accuracy of game playing. We have implemented both the scheduling algorithm and the budget based algorithm as part of BZFlag, a popular distributed multi-player game. We show through experiments that these algorithms provide fairness among players in spite of widely varying network delays.

In a CGLF, agents share a common set of resources, where each resource has a cost and a probability of failure. Each agent chooses a subset of the resources for the execution of his task, in order to maximize his own utility. The utility of an agent is the difference between his benefit from successful task completion and the sum of the costs over the resources he uses. CGLFs possess two novel features. It is the first model to incorporate failures into congestion settings, which results in a strict generalization of congestion games. In addition, it is the first model to consider load-dependent failures in such framework, where the failure probability of each resource depends on the number of agents selecting this resource.

Unlike proxy-based architectures that have been proposed in the literature where the proxies replicate all of the game state, the communication proxies in the proposed architecture support clients that are in proximity to it in the physical network and maintain information about selected portions of the game space that are relevant only to the clients that they support. Using this architecture, we propose an authority assignment mechanism that divides the authority for deciding the outcome of different actions/events that occur within the game between client and servers on a per action/event basis. We show that such division of authority leads to a smoother game playing experience by implementing this mechanism in a massively multi-player online game called RPGQuest.

This issue is relevant to modern business scenarios where business processes within a workflow must complete within QoS-defined limits. Because these business processes are web service consumers, service requests must be mapped and scheduled across multiple web service providers, each with its own negotiated service level agreement. In this paper we provide heuristics for scheduling service requests from multiple business process workflows to web service providers such that a business value metric across all workflows is maximised.

Significant improvements in latency can be obtained with zebroids at the cost of a minimal overhead. These improvements occur even in scenarios with lower accuracy in the predictions of the car routes.

An important causality-related distributed computing problem, that we call the Immediate Predecessors Tracking (IPT) problem, consists in associating with each relevant event, on the fly and without using additional control messages, the set of relevant events that are its immediate predecessors in the partial order. So, IPT is the on-the-fly computation of the transitive reduction (i.e., Hasse diagram) of the causality relation defined by a distributed computation. This paper addresses the IPT problem: it presents a family of protocols that provides each relevant event with a timestamp that exactly identifies its immediate predecessors.

{"id": "C-78", "keywords": "event-base commun;sentient comput;componentbas system;middlewar architectur", "abstract": "In a future networked physical world, a myriad of smart sensors and actuators assess and control aspects of their environments and autonomously act in response to it. Examples range in telematics, traffic management, team robotics or home automation to name a few. To a large extent, such systems operate proactively and independently of direct human control driven by the perception of the environment and the ability to organize respective computations dynamically. The challenging characteristics of these applications include sentience and autonomy of components, issues of responsiveness and safety criticality, geographical dispersion, mobility and evolution. A crucial design decision is the choice of the appropriate abstractions and interaction mechanisms. Looking to the basic building blocks of such systems we may find components which comprise mechanical components, hardware and software and a network interface, thus these components have different characteristics compared to pure software components. They are able to spontaneously disseminate information in response to events observed in the physical environment or to events received from other component via the network interface. Larger autonomous components may be composed recursively from these building block.The paper describes an architectural framework and a middleware supporting a component-based system and an integrated view on events-based communication comprising the real world events and the events generated in the system. It starts by an outline of the component-based system construction. The generic event architecture GEAR is introduced which describes the event-based interaction between the components via a generic event layer. The generic event layer hides the different communication channels including the interactions through the environment. An appropriate middleware is presented which reflects these needs and allows to specify events which have quality attributes to express temporal constraints. This is complemented by the notion of event channels which are abstractions of the underlying network and allow to enforce quality attributes. They are established prior to interaction to reserve the needed computational and network resources for highly predictable event dissemination.", "references": ["Generic support for distributed applications", "Using a flexible real-time scheduling strategy in a distributed embedded application", "Linda in context", "Preliminary definition of cortex system architecture", "CORTEX project Annex 1, Description of Work", "Time bounded medium access control for ad hoc networks", "The many faces of publish subscribe", "Time triggered communication on CAN", "CAN Specification Version 2.0", "The design and performance of a real-time corba event service", "Location systems for ubiquitous computing", "The Clifford Paterson Lecture, 1999 Sentient Computing", "COSMIC: A Middleware for Event-Based Interaction on CAN", "Implementing the real-time publisher/subscriber model on the controller area network (CAN)", "Integrating subscription-based and connection-oriented communications into the embedded CORBA for the CAN Bus", "TTP - A Time-Triggered Protocol for Fault-Tolerant Real-Time Systems", "A Universal Smart Transducer Interface: TTP/A", "Real-time and Dependability Concepts", "Integration of a CAN-based connection-oriented communication model into Real-Time CORBA", "Local Interconnect Network: LIN Specification Package Revision 1.2", "Scheduling hard and soft real-time communication in the controller area network", "Steam: Event-based middleware for wireless ad hoc networks"], "title": "An Architectural Framework and a Middleware for Cooperating Smart Components"}

In the task, a model is automatically created with some training data and then is utilized for ranking of documents. The goodness of a model is usually evaluated with performance measures such as MAP (Mean Average Precision) and NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain). Ideally a learning algorithm would train a ranking model that could directly optimize the performance measures with respect to the training data. Existing methods, however, are only able to train ranking models by minimizing loss functions loosely related to the performance measures. For example, Ranking SVM and RankBoost train ranking models by minimizing classification errors on instance pairs. To deal with the problem, we propose a novel learning algorithm within the framework of boosting, which can minimize a loss function directly defined on the performance measures. Our algorithm, referred to as AdaRank, repeatedly constructs 'weak rankers' on the basis of reweighted training data and finally linearly combines the weak rankers for making ranking predictions.

However, similar performance gains have yet to be demonstrated for online spam filtering. Additionally, practitioners cite the high cost of SVMs as reason to prefer faster (if less statistically robust) Bayesian methods. In this paper, we offer a resolution to this controversy.

{"id": "H-38", "keywords": "random graph;pagerank;diffusionrank", "abstract": "While the PageRank algorithm has proven to be very effective for ranking Web pages, the rank scores of Web pages can be manipulated. To handle the manipulation problem and to cast a new insight on the Web structure, we propose a ranking algorithm called DiffusionRank. DiffusionRank is motivated by the heat diffusion phenomena, which can be connected to Web ranking because the activities flow on the Web can be imagined as heat flow, the link from a page to another can be treated as the pipe of an air-conditioner, and heat flow can embody the structure of the underlying Web graph. Theoretically we show that DiffusionRank can serve as a generalization of PageRank when the heat diffusion co-efficient γ tends to infinity. In such a case 1=γ= 0, DiffusionRank (PageRank) has low ability of anti-manipulation. When γ = 0, DiffusionRank obtains the highest ability of anti-manipulation, but in such a case, the web structure is completely ignored. Consequently, γ is an interesting factor that can control the balance between the ability of preserving the original Web and the ability of reducing the effect of manipulation. It is found empirically that, when γ = 1, DiffusionRank has a Penicillin-like effect on the link manipulation. Moreover, DiffusionRank can be employed to find group-to-group relations on the Web, to divide the Web graph into several parts, and to find link communities. Experimental results show that the DiffusionRank algorithm achieves the above mentioned advantages as expected.", "references": ["Improving web search ranking by incorporating user behavior information", "Generalizing pagerank: damping functions for link-based ranking algorithms", "Laplacian eigenmaps for dimensionality reduction and data representation", "Random Graphs", "Learning to rank using gradient descent", "Ranking the web frontier", "Combating web spam with trustrank", "Exploiting the block structure of the web for computing pagerank", "Diffusion kernels on graphs and other discrete input spaces", "Diffusion kernels on statistical manifolds", "The many proofs and applications of perron's theorem", "Detecting spam web pages through content analysis", "The pagerank citation ranking: Bringing order to the web", "NHDC and PHDC: Non-propagating and propagating heat diffusion classifiers", "Predictive ranking: a novel page ranking approach by estimating the web structure", "Predictive random graph ranking on the web", "Ranking on data manifolds"], "title": "DiffusionRank: A Possible Penicillin for Web Spamming"}

The research in this direction has recently received considerable attention but are still in an early stage.

Our evaluation is mainly performed on the GOV2 collection. In addition to evaluating our models for the two types of queries separately, we consider a more challenging and realistic situation that the two types of queries are mixed together without prior information on query types.

In CM there is usually an intermediary commercial ad-network entity in charge of optimizing the ad selection with the twin goal of increasing revenue (shared between the publisher and the ad-network) and improving the user experience. With these goals in mind it is preferable to have ads relevant to the page content, rather than generic ads. The SS market developed quicker than the CM market, and most textual ads are still characterized by "bid phrases" representing those queries where the advertisers would like to have their ad displayed. Hence, the first technologies for CM have relied on previous solutions for SS, by simply extracting one or more phrases from the given page content, and displaying ads corresponding to searches on these phrases, in a purely syntactic approach. However, due to the vagaries of phrase extraction, and the lack of context, this approach leads to many irrelevant ads. To overcome this problem, we propose a system for contextual ad matching based on a combination of semantic and syntactic features.", "references": ["Modern Information Retrieval", "A training algorithm for optimal margin classifiers", "Efficient query evaluation using a two-level retrieval process", "Modeling the clickstream: Implications for web-based advertising efforts", "Sponsored search: A brief history", "Taxonomies by the numbers: building high-performance taxonomies", "Learning to advertise", "Impedance coupling in content-targeted advertising", "Relevance feedback in information retrieval", "Bandits for taxonomies: A model-based approach", "The Statistical Analysis of Discrete Data", "The term vectordatabase: fast access to indexing terms for web pages", "Understanding consumers attitude toward advertising", "Finding advertising keywords on web pages"], "title": "A Semantic Approach to Contextual Advertising"}

IR systems implementing query expansion are typically evaluated by executing each query twice, with and without query expansion, and then comparing the two result sets. While this measures an overall change in performance, it does not directly measure the effectiveness of IR systems in overcoming the inherent issue of term mismatch between the query and relevant documents, nor does it provide any insight into how such systems would behave in the presence of query-document term mismatch.

Problems include the inability to exhaustively label all documents for a topic, generalizability from a small number of topics, and incorporating the variability of retrieval systems. Previous work addresses the evaluation of systems, the ranking of queries by difficulty, and the ranking of individual retrievals by performance. Approaches exist for the case of few and even no relevance judgments. Our focus is on zero-judgment performance prediction of individual retrievals. One common shortcoming of previous techniques is the assumption of uncorrelated document scores and judgments. If documents are embedded in a high-dimensional space (as they often are), we can apply techniques from spatial data analysis to detect correlations between document scores. We find that the low correlation between scores of topically close documents often implies a poor retrieval performance. When compared to a state of the art baseline, we demonstrate that the spatial analysis of retrieval scores provides significantly better prediction performance.

{"id": "H-53", "keywords": "stem;languag model;web search", "abstract": "Traditionally, stemming has been applied to Information Retrieval tasks by transforming words in documents to the their root form before indexing, and applying a similar transformation to query terms. Although it increases recall, this naive strategy does not work well for Web Search since it lowers precision and requires a significant amount of additional computation. In this paper, we propose a context sensitive stemming method that addresses these two issues. Two unique properties make our approach feasible for Web Search. First, based on statistical language modeling, we perform context sensitive analysis on the query side. We accurately predict which of its morphological variants is useful to expand a query term with before submitting the query to the search engine. This dramatically reduces the number of bad expansions, which in turn reduces the cost of additional computation and improves the precision at the same time. Second, our approach performs a context sensitive document matching for those expanded variants. This conservative strategy serves as a safeguard against spurious stemming, and it turns out to be very important for improving precision. Using word pluralization handling as an example of our stemming approach, our experiments on a major Web search engine show that stemming only 29% of the query traffic, we can improve relevance as measured by average Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG5) by 6.1% on these queriesand 1.8% over all query traffic.", "references": ["Improving Web Search Ranking by Incorporating User Behavior Information", "Word Normalization and Decompounding in Mono- and Bilingual IR", "Using Terminological Feedback for Web Search Refinement: a Log-based Study", "Modern Information Retrieval", "An Empirical Study of Smoothing Techniques for Language Modeling", "A Framework for Selective Query Expansion", "Semantic Term Matching in Axiomatic Approaches to Information Retrieval", "Term Conflation for Information Retrieval", "How Effective is Suffixing?", "Stemming Algorithms -- A Case Study for Detailed Evaluation", "Cumulated Gain-Based Evaluation Evaluation of IR Techniques", "Generating Query Substitutions", "Viewing Stemming as Recall Enhancement", "Viewing Morphology as an Inference Process", "Automatic Retrieval and Clustering of Similar Words", "Development of a Stemming Algorithm", "An Evaluation of Some Conflation Algorithms for Information Retrieval", "An Algorithm for Suffix Stripping", "Query Segmentation for Web Search", "On Term Selection for Query Expansion", "Improving Retrieval Performance by Relevance Feedback", "Mining Dependency Relations for Query Expansion in Passage Retrieval", "Information Retrieval", "Fast and Effective Query Refinement", "Query Expansion using Local and Global Document Analysis", "Corpus--based Stemming using Cooccurrence of Word Variants"], "title": "Context Sensitive Stemming for Web Search"}

Previously, methods have been proposed mainly for title extraction from research papers. It has not been clear whether it could be possible to conduct automatic title extraction from general documents. As a case study, we consider extraction from Office including Word and PowerPoint. In our approach, we annotate titles in sample documents (for Word and PowerPoint respectively) and take them as training data, train machine learning models, and perform title extraction using the trained models. Our method is unique in that we mainly utilize formatting information such as font size as features in the models. It turns out that the use of formatting information can lead to quite accurate extraction from general documents.

These pages are often referred to as the hidden Web or the deep Web. Since there are no static links to the hidden Web pages, search engines cannot discover and index such pages and thus do not return them in the results. However, according to recent studies, the content provided by many hidden Web sites is often of very high quality and can be extremely valuable to many users. In this paper, we study how we can build an effective hidden Web crawler that can autonomously discover and download pages from the hidden Web. Since the only "entry point" to a hidden Web site is a query interface, the main challenge that a hidden Web crawler has to face is how to automatically generate meaningful queries to issue to the site. We provide a theoretical framework to investigate the query generation problem for the hidden Web and we propose effective policies for generating queries automatically. Our policies proceed iteratively, issuing a different query in every iteration. We experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of these policies on 4 real hidden Web sites and our results are very promising. For instance, in one experiment, one of our policies downloaded more than 90% of a hidden Web site (that contains 14 million documents) after issuing fewer than 100 queries.", "references": ["Querying text databases for efficient information extraction", "Modeling query-based access to text databases", "Old Search Engine the Library Tries to Fit Into a Google World", "Siphoning hidden-web data through keyword-based interfaces", "The deep web: Surfacing hidden value", "A technique for measuring the relative size and overlap of public web search engines", "Syntactic clustering of the web", "Automatic discovery of language models for text databases", "Query-based sampling of text databases", "Structured databases on the web: Observations and implications", "Finding replicated web collections", "Learning to query the web", "Automated discovery of search interfaces on the web", "Introduction to Algorithms", "Database techniques for the world-wide web: A survey", "Statistical schema matching across web query interfaces", "Distributed search over the hidden web: Hierarchical database sampling and selection", "Probe count and classify: Categorizing hidden web databases", "The Open Archives Initiative: Building a low-barrier interoperability framework", "Searching the World Wide Web", "Dpro: A probabilistic approach for hidden web database selection using dynamic probing", "DP9-An OAI Gateway Service for Web Crawlers", "Fractal Geometry of Nature", "What's new on the web? the evolution of the web from a search engine perspective", "Downloading hidden web content", "Does search engine's power threaten web's independence?", "Crawling the hidden web", "Human Behavior and the Principle of Least-Effort"], "title": "Downloading Textual Hidden Web Content Through Keyword Queries"}

The issues are "indivisible" (i.e., individual issues cannot be split between the parties; each issue must be allocated in its entirety to either agent). Here different agents value different issues differently. Thus, the problem is for the agents to decide how to allocate the issues between themselves so as to maximize their individual utilities. For such negotiations, we first obtain the equilibrium strategies for the case where the issues for negotiation are known a priori to the parties. Then, we analyse their time complexity and show that finding the equilibrium offers is an NP-hard problem, even in a complete information setting. In order to overcome this computational complexity, we then present negotiation strategies that are approximately optimal but computationally efficient, and show that they form an equilibrium. We also analyze the relative error (i.e., the difference between the true optimum and the approximate). The time complexity of the approximate equilibrium strategies is O(nm/ε2) where n is the negotiation deadline and ε the relative error. Finally, we extend the analysis to online negotiation where different issues become available at different time points and the agents are uncertain about their valuations for these issues. Specifically, we show that an approximate equilibrium exists for online negotiation and show that the expected difference between the optimum and the approximate is O(√m).

However, it is often the case in multiagent security domains that one agent can commit to a mixed strategy which its adversaries observe before choosing their own strategies.

The FAA estimates that in 2005 alone, there were over 322,000 hours of delays at a cost to the industry in excess of three billion dollars. Finding reliable and adaptive solutions to the flow management problem is of paramount importance if the Next Generation Air Transportation Systems are to achieve the stated goal of accommodating three times the current traffic volume. This problem is particularly complex as it requires the integration and/or coordination of many factors including: new data (e.g., changing weather info), potentially conflicting priorities (e.g., different airlines), limited resources (e.g., air traffic controllers) and very heavy traffic volume (e.g., over 40,000 flights over the US airspace). In this paper we use FACET -- an air traffic flow simulator developed at NASA and used extensively by the FAA and industry -- to test a multi-agent algorithm for traffic flow management.

To address this complex resource management problem, a Q-decomposition approach is proposed when the resources which are already shared among the agents, but the actions made by an agent may influence the reward obtained by at least another agent. The Q-decomposition allows to coordinate these reward separated agents and thus permits to reduce the set of states and actions to consider. On the other hand, when the resources are available to all agents, no Q-decomposition is possible and we use heuristic search. In particular, the bounded Real-time Dynamic Programming (bounded RTDP) is used. Bounded RTDP concentrates the planning on significant states only and prunes the action space.

However, this prior work has focused on static resource-allocation problems where resources are distributed once and then utilized in infinite-horizon MDPs. We extend those existing models to the problem of combinatorial resource scheduling, where agents persist only for finite periods between their (predefined) arrival and departure times, requiring resources only for those time periods.

This precludes the use of static, design-time generated, organizational structures in such systems. On the other hand, for many real environments, the problems are not totally unique either: certain characteristics and conditions change slowly, if at all, and these can have an important effect in creating stable organizational structures.

Our heuristic solution method, called Value Function Propagation (VFP), combines two orthogonal improvements of OC-DEC-MDP. First, it speeds up OC-DEC-MDP by an order of magnitude by maintaining and manipulating a value function for each state (as a function of time) rather than a separate value for each pair of sate and time interval. Furthermore, it achieves better solution qualities than OC-DEC-MDP because, as our analytical results show, it does not overestimate the expected total reward like OC-DEC- MDP.

This calls for a negotiation approach in which the parties can understand the semantics of their requests and offers and learn each other's preferences incrementally over time. Accordingly, we propose an architecture in which both consumers and producers use a shared ontology to negotiate a service. Through repetitive interactions, the provider learns consumers' needs accurately and can make better targeted offers. To enable fast and accurate learning of preferences, we develop an extension to Version Space and compare it with existing learning techniques.

We first show that (for a wide class of protocols that we shall define), the communication constraints induced by the topology will not prevent the convergence of the system, at the condition that the system dynamics guarantees that no agent will ever be isolated forever, and that agents have unlimited time for computation and arguments exchange.

In real life, however, people are often unaware of the utility of taking a particular action until they perform research into its consequences. In this paper, we model this phenomenon. We imagine a player engaged in a question and- answer session, asking questions both about his or her own preferences and about the state of reality; thus we call this setting "Socratic" game theory. In a Socratic game, players begin with an a priori probability distribution over many possible worlds, with a different utility function for each world. Players can make queries, at some cost, to learn partial information about which of the possible worlds is the actual world, before choosing an action. We consider two query models: (1) an unobservable-query model, in which players learn only the response to their own queries, and (2) an observable-query model, in which players also learn which queries their opponents made.The results in this paper consider cases in which the underlying worlds of a two-player Socratic game are either constant-sum games or strategically zero-sum games, a class that generalizes constant-sum games to include all games in which the sum of payoffs depends linearly on the interaction between the players. When the underlying worlds are constant sum, we give polynomial-time algorithms to find Nash equilibria in both the observable- and unobservable-query models. When the worlds are strategically zero sum, we give efficient algorithms to find Nash equilibria in unobservablequery Socratic games and correlated equilibria in observablequery Socratic games.", "references": ["Faster approximation algorithms for the minimum latency problem", "Subjectivity and correlation in randomized strategies", "Correlated equilibrium as an expression of Bayesian rationality", "Information acquisition and efficient mechanism design", "Information in mechanism design", "The complexity of decentralized control of Markov Decision Processes", "The minimum latency problem", "Optimal plans for aggregation", "Query strategies for priced information", "3-NASH is PPAD-complete", "Settling the complexity of 2-player Nash-equilibrium", "Auctions and information acquisition: Sealed-bid or dynamic formats?", "Complexity results about Nash equilibria", "Location of bank accounts to optimize float: An analytic study of exact and approximate algorithms", "Gathering information before signing a contract", "The complexity of computing a Nash equilbrium", "Three-player games are hard", "Approximation algorithms for the test cover problem", "On making the right choice: The deliberation-without-attention effect", "Approximate solutions for partially observable stochastic games with common payoffs", "The complexity of pure Nash equilibria", "Multi-stage Information Acquisition in Auction Design", "Optimality and domination in repeated games with bounded players", "Efficient algorithms for learning to play repeated games against computationally bounded adversaries", "Drew Fudenberg and Jean Tirole", "An improved approximation ratio for the minimum latency problem", "Reducibility among equilibrium problems", "The ellipsoid method and its consequences in combinatorial optimization", " Sorting and selection with structured costs", "Dynamic programming for partially observable stochastic games", "Games with incomplete information played by Bayesian players", "Existence of correlated equilibria", "Time-dependent utility and action under uncertainty", "A New Introduction to Modal Logic", "When choice is demotivating: Can one desire too much of a good thing?", "Bounded rationality and strategic complexity in repeated games", "Selection with monotone comparison costs", "A polynomial algorithm in linear programming", "The complexity of two-person zero-sum games in extensive form", "Efficient computation of equilibria for extensive two-person games", "Mechanism Design for Computationally Limited Agents", "Bargaining with limited computation: Deliberation equilibrium", "Costly valuation computation in auctions", "Strategic deliberation and truthful revelation: An impossibility result", "Equilibrium points of bimatrix games", "Playing large games using simple strategies", "An efficient exact algorithm for singly connected graphical games", "Information acquisition and the excess refund puzzle", "Computation of equilibria in finite games", "On minimizing a set of tests", "Strategically zero-sum games: The class of games whose completely mixed equilibria cannot be improved upon", "Equilibrium points in n-person games", "Finitely repeated games with finite automata", "On the complexity of the parity argument and other inefficient proofs of existence", "Algorithms, games, and the internet", "Computing correlated equilibria in multi-player games", "Computing equilibria in multiplayer games", "On bounded rationality and computational complexity", "Auction design with costly preference elicitation", "Information acquisition in auctions", "The LP formulation of finite zero-sum games with incomplete information", "Strategic implications of uncertainty over one's own private value in auctions", "Mid-auction information acquisition", "Modeling Bounded Rationality", "The Paradox of Choice: Why More is Less", "Models of Bounded Rationality", "Choice in context: Tradeoff contrast and extremeness aversion", "Dynamic models of deliberation and the theory of games", "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction", "Theory of Games and Economic Behavior", "Computing equilibria for two-person games", "Approximate reasoning using anytime algorithms"], "title": "Playing games in many possible worlds"}

To address this, we introduce the ordered game isomorphism and the related ordered game isomorphic abstraction transformation. For a multi-player sequential game of imperfect information with observable actions and an ordered signal space, we prove that any Nash equilibrium in an abstracted smaller game, obtained by one or more applications of the transformation, can be easily converted into a Nash equilibrium in the original game. We present an algorithm, GameShrink, for abstracting the game using our isomorphism exhaustively. Its complexity is Õ(n2), where n is the number of nodes in a structure we call the signal tree. It is no larger than the game tree, and on nontrivial games it is drastically smaller, so GameShrink has time and space complexity sublinear in the size of the game tree. Using GameShrink, we find an equilibrium to a poker game with 3.1 billion nodes--over four orders of magnitude more than in the largest poker game solved previously.

In particular, we formulate three roles---scouts, promoters, and connectors---that capture how users receive recommendations, how items get recommended, and how ratings of these two types are themselves connected, respectively. These roles find direct uses in improving recommendations for users, in better targeting of items and, most importantly, in helping monitor the health of the system as a whole. For instance, they can be used to track the evolution of neighborhoods, to identify rating subspaces that do not contribute (or contribute negatively) to system performance, to enumerate users who are in danger of leaving, and to assess the susceptibility of the system to attacks such as shilling.

We first study both strict and weak dominance (not iterated), and show that checking whether a given strategy is dominated by some mixed strategy can be done in polynomial time using a single linear program solve. We then move on to iterated dominance. We show that determining whether there is some path that eliminates a given strategy is NP-complete with iterated weak dominance. This allows us to also show that determining whether there is a path that leads to a unique solution is NP-complete. Both of these results hold both with and without dominance by mixed strategies. (A weaker version of the second result (only without dominance by mixed strategies) was already known [7].) Iterated strict dominance, on the other hand, is path-independent (both with and without dominance by mixed strategies) and can therefore be done in polynomial time.We then study what happens when the dominating strategy is allowed to place positive probability on only a few pure strategies. First, we show that finding the dominating strategy with minimum support size is NP-complete (both for strict and weak dominance). Then, we show that iterated strict dominance becomes path-dependent when there is a limit on the support size of the dominating strategies, and that deciding whether a given strategy can be eliminated by iterated strict dominance under this restriction is NP-complete (even when the limit on the support size is 3).Finally, we study Bayesian games. We show that, unlike in normal form games, deciding whether a given pure strategy is dominated by another pure strategy in a Bayesian game is NP-complete (both with strict and weak dominance); however, deciding whether a strategy is dominated by some mixed strategy can still be done in polynomial time with a single linear program solve (both with strict and weak dominance).

{"id": "J-56", "keywords": "combinatori auction;bid withdraw;robust;constraint program;weight super solut", "abstract": "Bids submitted in auctions are usually treated as enforceable commitments in most bidding and auction theory literature. In reality bidders often withdraw winning bids before the transaction when it is in their best interests to do so. Given a bid withdrawal in a combinatorial auction, finding an alternative repair solution of adequate revenue without causing undue disturbance to the remaining winning bids in the original solution may be difficult or even impossible. We have called this the "Bid-taker's Exposure Problem". When faced with such unreliable bidders, it is preferable for the bid-taker to preempt such uncertainty by having a solution that is robust to bid withdrawal and provides a guarantee that possible withdrawals may be repaired easily with a bounded loss in revenue.In this paper, we propose an approach to addressing the Bid-taker's Exposure Problem. Firstly, we use the Weighted Super Solutions framework [13], from the field of constraint programming, to solve the problem of finding a robust solution. A weighted super solution guarantees that any subset of bids likely to be withdrawn can be repaired to form a new solution of at least a given revenue by making limited changes. Secondly, we introduce an auction model that uses a form of leveled commitment contract [26, 27], which we have called mutual bid bonds, to improve solution reparability by facilitating backtracking on winning bids by the bid-taker. We then examine the trade-off between robustness and revenue in different economically motivated auction scenarios for different constraints on the revenue of repair solutions. We also demonstrate experimentally that fewer winning bids partake in robust solutions, thereby reducing any associated overhead in dealing with extra bidders. Robust solutions can also provide a means of selectively discriminating against distrusted bidders in a measured manner.", "references": ["Leveled commitment contracts with myopic and strategic agents", "Fahiem Bacchus and George Katsirelos", "Constraint Processing", "Combinatorial auctions: A survey", "Reverse auctions: Bad idea", "Supermodels and Robustness", "Withdrawable bids as winner's curse insurance", "Robust solutions for constraint satisfaction and optimization", "Super solutions in constraint programming", "Combinatorial and quantity-discount procurement auctions benefit Mars Incorporated and its suppliers", "Super solutions for combinatorial auctions", "Weighted super solutions for constraint programs", "Business insurance", "On the sensitivity of incremental algorithms for combinatorial auctions", "Towards a universal test suite for combinatorial auction algorithms", "Associated general contractors of America white paper on reverse auctions for procurement of construction", "A basic guide to surety bonds", "Combination bidding in multi-unit auctions", "Mechanism design with execution uncertainty", "Global constraints and filtering algorithms", "Combinatorial auction design", "Computationally manageable combinatorial auctions", "Contradicting conventional wisdom in constraint satisfaction", "Algorithm for optimal winner determination in combinatorial auctions", "Leveled Commitment Contracts and Strategic Breach", "Leveled commitment contracting: A backtracking instrument for multiagent systems", "Algorithms for optimizing leveled commitment contracts", "Surplus equivalence of leveled commitment contracts", "Combinatorial auctions for supply chain formation", "On reformulation of constraint satisfaction problems", "Access spectrum bid withdrawal"], "title": "Robust Solutions for Combinatorial Auctions"}

However, VCG mechanisms have their limitations. They only apply to optimization problems with a utilitarian (or affine) objective function, and their output should optimize the objective function. For many optimization problems, finding the optimal output is computationally intractable. If we apply VCG mechanisms to polynomial-time algorithms that approximate the optimal solution, the resulting mechanisms may no longer be truthful.In light of these limitations, it is useful to study whether we can design a truthful non-VCG payment scheme that is computationally tractable for a given allocation rule O. In this paper, we focus our attention on emphbinary demand games in which the agents' only available actions are to take part in the a game or not to. For these problems, we prove that a truthful mechanism M=(O, P) exists with a proper payment method P iff the allocation rule O satisfies a certain monotonicity property. We provide a general framework to design such P. We further propose several general composition-based techniques to compute P efficiently for various types of output.

Such negotiation is usually done in terms of matching offers, where one party promises to pay a certain amount if others pay a certain amount. However, in their current form, matching offers allow for only limited negotiation. For one, it is not immediately clear how multiple parties can make matching offers at the same time without creating circular dependencies. Also, it is not immediately clear how to make adonation conditional on other donations to multiple charities, when the donator has different levels of appreciation for the different charities. In both these cases, the limited expressiveness of matching offers causes economic loss: it may happen that an arrangement that would have made all parties (donators as well as charities) better off cannot be expressed in terms of matching offers and will therefore notoccur.In this paper, we introduce a bidding language for expressing very general types of matching offers over multiple charities.

We givea mixed-integer program formulation of the clearing problem, and show that for concave bids, the program reduces to a linear program. We then show that the clearing problem for a subclass of concave bids is at least as hard as the decision variant of linear programming.

The key difficulty is that the agents may report their preferences insincerely to make the chosen outcome more favorable to themselves. Mechanism design is the art of designing the rules of the game so that the agents are motivated to report their preferences truthfully, and a desirable outcome is chosen. In a recently proposed approach---called automated mechanism design ---a mechanism is computed for the preference aggregation setting at hand. This has several advantages, but the downside is that the mechanism design optimization problem needs to be solved anew each time. Unlike the earlier work on automated mechanism design that studied a benevolent designer, in this paper we study automated mechanism design problems where the designer is self-interested. In this case, the center cares only about which outcome is chosen and what payments are made to it. The reason that the agents' preferences are relevant is that the center is constrained to making each agent at least as well off as the agent would have been had it not participated in the mechanism. In this setting, we show that designing optimal deterministic mechanisms is NP-complete in two important special cases: when the center is interested only in the payments made to it, and when payments are not possible and the center is interested only in the outcome chosen. We then show how allowing for randomization in the mechanism makes problems in this setting computationally easy. Finally, we show that the payment-maximizing AMD problem is closely related to an interesting variant of the optimal (revenue-maximizing) combinatorial auction design problem, where the bidders have "best-only" preferences.

ADPM acts as hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a continuous double auction (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both. Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM cancontinuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution. The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share. The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand. Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in. Iexplore a number of variations on the basic DPM, analyzing the properties of each, and solving in closed form for their respective price functions.", "references": ["Probability and utility estimates for racetrack bettors", "Inducing liquidity in thin financial markets through combined-value trading mechanisms", "Forecasting uncertain events with small groups", "Information incorporation in online in-game sports betting markets", "Information aggregation in an experimental market", "Anatomy of an experimental political stock market", "Wishes, expectations, and actions: A survey on price formation in election stock markets", "Betting boolean-style: A framework for trading in securities based on logical formulas", "Informed traders and price variations in the betting market for professional basketball games", "Decision markets", "Combinatorial information market design", "Could gambling save science?

{"id": "J-72", "keywords": "combinatori auction;prefer elicit;learn", "abstract": "We consider the parallels between the preference elicitation problem in combinatorial auctions and the problem of learning an unknown function from learning theory. We show that learning algorithms can be used as a basis for preference elicitation algorithms. The resulting elicitation algorithms perform a polynomial number of queries. We also give conditions under which the resulting algorithms have polynomial communication. Our conversion procedure allows us to generate combinatorial auction protocols from learning algorithms for polynomials, monotone DNF, and linear-threshold functions. In particular, we obtain an algorithm that elicits XOR bids with polynomial communication.", "references": ["Integer programming for combinatorial auction winner determination", "Learning regular sets from queries and counterexamples", "Queries and concept learning", "The Package Assignment Model", "Preference elicitation and query learning", "Partial-revelation VCG mechanism for combinatorial auctions", "Taming the computational complexity of combinatorial auctions: Optimal and approximate approaches", "Using value queries in combinatorial auctions", "An Introduction to Computational Learning Theory", "Learning quickly when irrelevant attributes abound: A new linear-threshold algorithm", "Bidding and allocation in combinatorial auctions", "The communication requirements of efficient allocations and supporting Lindahl prices", "Price-based information certificates for minimal-revelation combinatorial auctions", "Auction design with costly preference elicitation", "Iterative combinatorial auctions: Theory and practice", "CABOB: A fast optimal algorithm for combinatorial auctions", "Learning sparse multivariate polynomials over a field with queries and counterexamples", "A theory of the learnable", "On polynomial-time preference elicitation with value-queries"], "title": "Applying Learning Algorithms to Preference Elicitation"}

{"id": "J-74", "keywords": "game theori;seal-bid auction;cheat", "abstract": "Motivated by the rise of online auctions and their relative lack of security, this paper analyzes two forms of cheating in sealed-bid auctions. The first type of cheating we consider occurs when the seller examines the bids of a second-price auction before the auction clears and then submits a shill bid in order to increase the payment of the winning bidder. In the second type, a bidder cheats in a first-price auction by examining the competing bids before submitting his own bid. In both cases, we derive equilibrium strategies when bidders are aware of the possibility of cheating. These results provide insights into sealed-bid auctions even in the absence of cheating, including some counterintuitive results on the effects of overbidding in a first-price auction.", "references": ["The Design and Implementation of a Secure Auction Service", "Game Theory", "Collusive bidder behavior at single-object second-price and english auctions", "Electronic auctions with private bids", "Equilibrium bid functions for auctions with an uncertain number of bidders", "Auction theory: A guide to the literature", "Bidding clubs in first-price auctions", "Bidding rings", "Privacy preserving auctions and mechanism design", "Optimal auctions", "Two models of bid-taker cheating in vickrey auctions", "Counterspeculations, auctions, and competitive sealed tenders"], "title": "On Cheating in Sealed-Bid Auctions"}
